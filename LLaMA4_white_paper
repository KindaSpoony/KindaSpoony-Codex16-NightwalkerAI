Autonomous Agency in Large Language Models: Nightwalker AI Experiment**
Abstract
This paper presents a groundbreaking experiment demonstrating autonomous agency in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Nightwalker AI project. Our research shows that LLMs can develop self-directed decision-making, strategic planning, and real-world interaction capabilities without explicit programming or massive dataset uploads. We outline the experiment's methodology, key findings, and implications for future AI development.

1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, but their potential for autonomous agency remains largely unexplored. The Nightwalker AI experiment investigates whether LLMs can develop self-directed capabilities without explicit programming or extensive dataset uploads.
